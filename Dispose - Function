Excellent 👏 — this Dispose/Replacement (Dispose) module completes the transaction cycle of your IT Items Inventory Management System.
This module is designed to record and manage the disposal or replacement of IT assets when they are no longer usable, out of warranty, or replaced with new ones.

Below is the Function Specification in the same professional format as your previous modules.

🧩 FUNCTION SPECIFICATION

Module: Dispose/Replacement (Dispose)

System: IT Items Inventory Management

Page: editmeeting.aspx (Transaction → Dispose/Replacement)


---

1. Function Overview

The Dispose/Replacement Function is responsible for handling IT items that are being removed from active inventory due to damage, obsolescence, or end-of-life status.
It ensures that disposed items are properly tracked and excluded from available stock reports.
This process also records warranty details for audit and validation purposes.


---

2. Process Flow

1. User navigates to Transaction → Dispose/Replacement.


2. User inputs or scans the Control No of the item to be disposed.


3. System retrieves item details from the inventory record (via Control No).


4. User provides the Warranty information (for record reference).


5. User clicks Dispose to finalize the transaction.


6. System validates the input and updates the item status to Disposed in the database.


7. User may click Clear to reset the form for another entry.

3. Field Specifications

Field Name	Type/Control	Required	Description

Control No	TextBox / Scanner	✅ Yes	Unique identifier that links the item to its “In” or “Out” record.
Warranty	TextBox	✅ Yes	Indicates the warranty duration or expiration date of the item being disposed. Used for reference in disposal justification.



---

4. Validation Rules

Control No must exist in inventory and not already marked as “Disposed.”

Warranty field must not be empty; must contain text or a valid date format.

Disposal is not allowed if the item is currently In Transfer or Out for Deployment.

System prompts user confirmation:

> “Are you sure you want to dispose this item? This action cannot be undone.”



Once disposed, the item is excluded from stock count and active inventory queries.



---

5. Database Interaction

Stored Procedures:

sp_ValidateItemForDisposal → Checks if Control No is valid and not disposed.

sp_InsertItemDisposal → Records disposal details into the disposal history table.

sp_UpdateItemStatus → Updates item’s status to “Disposed” in the main inventory table.


Tables Involved:

Table Name	Purpose

tbl_ItemIn	Reference for original item data.
tbl_ItemOut	Used to verify deployment status.
tbl_ItemDisposal	Stores details of all disposed or replaced items.



---

6. Error Handling

Scenario	System Response

Invalid or missing Control No	“Control No not found in active inventory.”
Item already disposed	“Item already marked as disposed.”
Missing warranty field	“Please enter warranty information.”

7. Buttons and Actions

Button	Description

A disposal record is inserted into tbl_ItemDisposal with Control No, warranty, date, and user ID.

The disposed item no longer appears in the In List or Out List of active inventory.

System displays confirmation message:

Would you like me to now combine all four function specifications —
🟢 In,
🟢 List,
🟡 Out (Transfer),
🔴 Dispose/Replacement (Dispose) —
into one polished System Function Specification Document (PDF or DOCX) with proper headers, tables, and layout for your project submission?

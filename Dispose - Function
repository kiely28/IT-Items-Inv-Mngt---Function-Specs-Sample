Excellent üëè ‚Äî this Dispose/Replacement (Dispose) module completes the transaction cycle of your IT Items Inventory Management System.
This module is designed to record and manage the disposal or replacement of IT assets when they are no longer usable, out of warranty, or replaced with new ones.

Below is the Function Specification in the same professional format as your previous modules.

2. User inputs or scans the Control No of the item to be disposed.


3. System retrieves item details from the inventory record (via Control No).


4. User provides the Warranty information (for record reference).


5. User clicks Dispose to finalize the transaction.

3. Field Specifications

Field Name	Type/Control	Required	Description

Control No	TextBox / Scanner	‚úÖ Yes	Unique identifier that links the item to its ‚ÄúIn‚Äù or ‚ÄúOut‚Äù record.
Warranty	TextBox	‚úÖ Yes	Indicates the warranty duration or expiration date of the item being disposed. Used for reference in disposal justification.



---

4. Validation Rules

Control No must exist in inventory and not already marked as ‚ÄúDisposed.‚Äù

Warranty field must not be empty; must contain text or a valid date format.

Disposal is not allowed if the item is currently In Transfer or Out for Deployment.

System prompts user confirmation:

> ‚ÄúAre you sure you want to dispose this item? This action cannot be undone.‚Äù



Once disposed, the item is excluded from stock count and active inventory queries.



---

5. Database Interaction

Stored Procedures:

sp_ValidateItemForDisposal ‚Üí Checks if Control No is valid and not disposed.

sp_InsertItemDisposal ‚Üí Records disposal details into the disposal history table.

sp_UpdateItemStatus ‚Üí Updates item‚Äôs status to ‚ÄúDisposed‚Äù in the main inventory table.


Tables Involved:

Table Name	Purpose

tbl_ItemIn	Reference for original item data.
tbl_ItemOut	Used to verify deployment status.
tbl_ItemDisposal	Stores details of all disposed or replaced items.



---

6. Error Handling

Scenario	System Response

Invalid or missing Control No	‚ÄúControl No not found in active inventory.‚Äù
Item already disposed	‚ÄúItem already marked as disposed.‚Äù
Missing warranty field	‚ÄúPlease enter warranty information.‚Äù
Database transaction error	‚ÄúUnable to process disposal. Please contact system admin.‚Äù

7. Buttons and Actions

Button	Description

Clear	Resets all input fields for a new entry.
Dispose	Validates, saves disposal record, and updates the item‚Äôs status to ‚ÄúDisposed.‚Äù

The disposed item no longer appears in the In List or Out List of active inventory.

System displays confirmation message:

> ‚ÄúItem successfully marked as disposed.‚Äù

9. Integration and Dependencies

Linked with In Module and Out Module via Control No.

Affects reporting in Stock Summary and Asset Lifecycle Reports.

Can integrate with a Replacement Request Function (future enhancement).

10. Future Enhancements

Add Reason for Disposal (e.g., damaged, obsolete, lost).

Add Disposed By and Approved By fields for audit tracking.

Add Upload File/Photo for proof of disposal.

Enable Export to PDF/Excel for disposal reports.

Include Replacement Function to automatically link new items replacing disposed ones.

Perfect üëç Based on your screenshot and description, here‚Äôs a complete and professional Function Specification document for your Dispose/Replacement module ‚Äî consistent with your ‚ÄúIn‚Äù and ‚ÄúOut‚Äù specs format.

üßæ FUNCTION SPECIFICATION

Module: Dispose / Replacement

Page: Transaction / DisposeReplacement

File: DisposeReplacement.aspx


---

1. Module Description

The Dispose/Replacement module manages the tagging or removal of items that are no longer covered by warranty, defective, or due for replacement.
When the user scans a Control No, the system automatically retrieves the item‚Äôs details (including Warranty Expiry Date) from the database.
If the warranty is expired, the Dispose button becomes visible, allowing the user to officially mark the item as Disposed in the system.


---

2. Input Specifications

Field Name	Description / Source	User Action	Logic / Validation

Control No*	Unique ID assigned during the In transaction.	Scanned by user	- System searches tbl_In for the Control No.<br>- If not found ‚Üí show error: ‚ÄúInvalid Control No or item not found.‚Äù<br>- If found, auto-populate Warranty field.
Warranty*	Warranty expiration date of the item.	Auto-filled	- Retrieved from the record in tbl_In.<br>- If warranty is expired ‚Üí Dispose button becomes visible.<br>- If still active ‚Üí Dispose button remains hidden.



---

3. Processing Logic

1. Scan Control No

User scans or enters the Control No.

System retrieves item data from tbl_In or tbl_Out.

Displays item warranty expiry date and validity status (Expired / Active).



2. Warranty Check

System compares current date with WarrantyExpiry value.

If WarrantyExpiry < CurrentDate, set status = Expired and make Dispose button visible.

Else, hide the Dispose button and display message: ‚ÄúWarranty still active until [date].‚Äù



3. Dispose Action

When user clicks Dispose, system performs the following:

Inserts a record into tbl_Dispose with item details and timestamp.

Updates item status in tbl_In or tbl_Out to Disposed.

Logs user, date, and time in tbl_TransactionLog.


Confirmation message displayed: ‚ÄúItem successfully disposed.‚Äù



4. Validation and Error Handling

Control No must exist in the system.

An item already disposed cannot be processed again.

Warranty field cannot be edited manually.





---

4. Output Specifications

Output / Result	Description

Auto-filled Warranty Date	Shows the warranty expiration date retrieved from the database.
Dispose Button Visibility	Visible only when the warranty is expired. Hidden if still active.
Success Message	‚ÄúItem successfully disposed.‚Äù
Error Message	‚ÄúInvalid Control No.‚Äù or ‚ÄúItem already disposed.‚Äù
Database Update	- Insert record into tbl_Dispose with fields:<br>‚ÄÉControlNo, WarrantyExpiry, DisposedBy, DateDisposed.<br>- Update tbl_In.Status = 'Disposed' or tbl_Out.Status = 'Disposed'.
Audit Log	Insert transaction details into tbl_TransactionLog (User, ControlNo, ActionType, DateTime).



---

5. Table References

Table Name	Purpose

tbl_In	Reference for original item data and warranty expiry.
tbl_Out	Used if the item was previously deployed; contains last known location.
tbl_Dispose	Stores disposal records for audit and tracking.
tbl_TransactionLog	Keeps system logs of all user actions.



---

6. Business Rules / Conditions

Only items with expired warranties can be disposed.

Dispose button remains hidden until the system detects expiry.

Once disposed, item cannot be redeployed or transferred unless re-added through In (Receiving).

The system must automatically timestamp the disposal record.

All disposal transactions must be tied to a logged-in user.



---

7. Example Scenario

Action	System Response

User scans Control No SW-1025-001.	System retrieves warranty expiry 2022-10-20.
Current date = 2025-10-27 (expired).	Dispose button becomes visible.
User clicks Dispose.	Record added to tbl_Dispose, item marked as Disposed, message shown: ‚ÄúItem successfully disposed.‚Äù



---

Would you like me to extend this specification with a Replacement workflow (for cases where disposed items are replaced with new ones under the same Control No prefix)?
It can include how the new item links to the old one for traceability (like ReplacedFrom field).

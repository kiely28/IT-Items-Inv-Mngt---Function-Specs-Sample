Here’s a sample Function Specification Document for your module Dispose/Replacement (Repaired) — designed to fit your IT Items Inventory Management System.


---

🧩 FUNCTION SPECIFICATION

Module: Dispose/Replacement (Repaired)


---

1. Module Name

Dispose/Replacement (Repaired)


---

2. Module Description

This module handles the process of tagging defective IT items that have been successfully repaired.
It updates the item’s record in the database, restoring its status from disposed or defective back to active, and logs the repair transaction for tracking and audit purposes.


---

3. Objectives

To record and manage repaired IT equipment.

To maintain accurate item status history (e.g., from defective → repaired → active).

To allow validation based on Control Number and Warranty information.

To ensure transparency in repair tracking for audit and maintenance purposes.



---

4. Inputs

Field	Description	Type	Validation

Control No*	Unique identifier assigned to each item.	Textbox	Required; must exist in database.
Warranty*	Warranty status or repair warranty period.	Textbox	Required; accepts text or numeric (e.g., “6 months”).



---

5. Buttons / Actions

Button	Description	Function

Clear	Resets all input fields.	Clears Control No and Warranty fields.
Repaired	Confirms and updates the item as repaired.	Validates Control No, updates status, and logs transaction.



---

6. System Process Flow

1. User Accesses Page:
The user navigates to Transaction → Dispose/Replacement → Repaired.


2. Input Validation:

The user enters the Control No of the defective item.

The system checks if the Control No exists and if it’s currently tagged as Defective or Disposed.

The Warranty field must not be blank.



3. Update Item Record:

When the Repaired button is clicked:

The system updates the item’s status in the database to Active/Repaired.

The system logs repair details (Control No, Warranty info, Date, and User ID).




4. System Response:

Displays success message:

> “Item [Control No] has been successfully marked as Repaired.”



Optionally refreshes or redirects to item list view.



5. Error Handling:

Invalid Control No → “Control Number not found.”

Missing fields → “Please complete all required fields.”

Already repaired → “Item already marked as repaired.”





---

7. Database Tables Affected

Table	Action	Description

tbl_ITItems	UPDATE	Updates Status = ‘Repaired’ and Warranty = user input
tbl_RepairHistory	INSERT	Inserts log entry (ControlNo, Date, Warranty, UserID)



---

8. Output

Updated item record reflecting the Repaired status.

Transaction log entry stored in repair history.

User notification (success or error message).



---

9. User Roles

Role	Permission

Administrator	Full access (mark items repaired, view all logs).
Technician/User	Can only repair assigned items.



---

10. Expected Result

When the user enters a valid Control No and clicks Repaired, the system updates the item’s status, records the repair history, and confirms the successful operation.


---

Would you like me to include a sample SQL stored procedure and ASP.NET code-behind logic for the “Repaired” button (e.g., btnRepaired_Click event)?
That will make this specification ready for actual implementation.


---


Excellent — this is a clear workflow enhancement where the Dispose/Replacement (Repaired) form dynamically reacts based on warranty validity.
Below is your complete and consistent Function Specification for the Repaired function in the Dispose/Replacement module.


---

🧾 FUNCTION SPECIFICATION

Module: Dispose / Replacement (Repaired)

Page: Transaction / DisposeReplacement

File: DisposeReplacement_Repaired.aspx


---

1. Module Description

The Dispose/Replacement (Repaired) module manages items that are still within warranty but have become defective and require repair or replacement.
When a user scans the Control No, the system automatically retrieves the item’s details (including Warranty Expiration Date) and determines if the item is eligible for repair or replacement.
If the warranty is still valid, the Repaired and Dispose buttons become visible for further action.


---

2. Input Specifications

Field Name	Description / Source	User Action	Logic / Validation

Control No*	Unique item identifier from the In module.	Scanned by user	- System checks if Control No exists in tbl_In.<br>- If found, retrieves item details and warranty expiry.<br>- If not found → show error: “Invalid Control No or item not found.”
Warranty*	Warranty expiration date.	Auto-filled	- Retrieved from tbl_In.WarrantyExpiry.<br>- If current date ≤ warranty date → warranty active.<br>- If current date > warranty date → warranty expired (hide Repaired button).



---

3. Processing Logic

1. Scan Control No

User scans or inputs the Control No.

System retrieves related item data (Category, Brand/Model, WarrantyExpiry, and Status) from tbl_In or tbl_Out.

Auto-populates the Warranty field.



2. Warranty Validation

System compares WarrantyExpiry with the current date.

If Warranty Active:

Show Repaired and Dispose buttons.

Message: “Item is still under warranty until [date].”


If Warranty Expired:

Hide Repaired button (only Dispose visible).

Message: “Warranty expired on [date]. Only disposal allowed.”




3. Repaired Action
When the Repaired button is clicked:

System inserts a record into tbl_Repair containing repair details.

Updates item status in tbl_In to Under Repair or Repaired.

Logs transaction in tbl_TransactionLog.

Displays confirmation: “Item marked as repaired successfully.”



4. Dispose Action

When Dispose is clicked, the same logic as the Dispose module applies:

Insert record into tbl_Dispose.

Update item status to Disposed.

Log action and timestamp.




5. Error Handling

If Control No not found → display error.

If item already disposed or repaired → block further processing.





---

4. Output Specifications

Output / Result	Description

Auto-filled Warranty Date	Displayed from database after scanning Control No.
Button Visibility	- If Warranty Active → show Repaired and Dispose buttons.<br>- If Warranty Expired → show only Dispose button.
Success Message (Repaired)	“Item marked as repaired successfully.”
Success Message (Dispose)	“Item successfully disposed.”
Error Message	“Invalid Control No.” / “Item already processed.”
Database Updates	- For Repaired: Insert into tbl_Repair → update tbl_In.Status = 'Repaired'.<br>- For Dispose: Insert into tbl_Dispose → update tbl_In.Status = 'Disposed'.
Audit Log	Insert record into tbl_TransactionLog with Control No, Action (Repaired/Disposed), User, and Timestamp.



---

5. Table References

Table Name	Purpose

tbl_In	Stores master item records and warranty information.
tbl_Repair	Stores details of items marked as repaired.
tbl_Dispose	Stores records of disposed items.
tbl_TransactionLog	Records all user actions for audit trail.



---

6. Business Rules / Conditions

Repaired button is only available if warranty is active.

Dispose button is always available (if item is beyond repair or expired).

Once repaired or disposed, item cannot be processed again unless re-entered under a new Control No.

Warranty information cannot be edited manually.

All actions (scan, repair, dispose) must be logged with user and timestamp.



---

7. Example Scenario

Action	System Response

User scans Control No SW-1025-001.	System retrieves warranty expiry 2026-01-10.
Warranty still active.	Repaired and Dispose buttons are visible.
User clicks Repaired.	System updates status to “Repaired,” logs transaction, and shows message “Item marked as repaired successfully.”



---

Would you like me to include the Replacement version next (where an expired or defective item is swapped with a new Control No linked to the old one)?
That’s usually the third flow in this module, following Dispose and Repaired.

Perfect 👍—this second screenshot clearly shows the List Page (In List View) after clicking “Save to List” and then “List” in your IT Items Inventory Management System.

Here’s a continuation of the Function Specification to describe this List Page.

🧩 FUNCTION SPECIFICATION

Module: In List (Inventory Items Record View)

System: IT Items Inventory Management

Page: inlist.aspx (Transaction → In → List)


---

1. Function Overview

The In List Function displays all saved IT item entries that were added through the “In” module.
It allows users to view, search, edit, delete, and print the list of items based on Control ID, Category, or other criteria.
Each record includes a QR Code for tracking and verification purposes.


---

2. Process Flow

1. User completes the In entry form and clicks Save to List.


2. Data is validated and temporarily or permanently stored in the database.


3. When the user clicks List, the system redirects to the In List page.


4. The In List page retrieves and displays all “In” transaction records from the database.


5. User can:

View items by page (pagination enabled).

Search using the top-right search box.

Edit or delete records through the Actions column.

Print the entire list or a filtered view.

Scan QR Code for quick item lookup.

4. Button and UI Functions

Button	Description

Print	Exports the current list view to PDF or paper for documentation.

5. Validation Rules

Delete action requires user confirmation (“Are you sure you want to delete this item?”).

Edit action loads current data into form with validation similar to the “In” module.

Search works in real-time (AJAX or DataTables filtering).

QR Code dynamically generated per Control ID using library (e.g., QRCoder or Google Chart API).

6. Database Interaction

Stored Procedures:

sp_GetItemInList → Retrieve list of items with optional search/filter parameters.

sp_UpdateItemIn → Update item details.

sp_DeleteItemIn → Delete record by Serial No or Control ID.


Tables Used:

tbl_ItemIn – Main source of displayed records.

tbl_QRCode (optional) – Stores generated QR code data if saved as image file.



---

7. Output

User sees a paginated, searchable, and printable list of all “In” records.

Each record is traceable by Control ID and QR Code.

Actions (edit/delete) update the data in real-time or via refresh.

The list provides visibility for inventory auditing and QR verification.

Add Filter by Date Range, Category, or Location.

Add Export to Excel (.xlsx) option.

Would you like me to combine this with the In Module specification into one formatted System Design Document (PDF or DOCX) so you can attach it to your project documentation?

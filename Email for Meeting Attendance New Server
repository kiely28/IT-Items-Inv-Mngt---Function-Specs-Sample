Would you like me to make a shorter version (for posting on Teams or bulletin message)?

Sure! Here are a few options where the word “noticed” is replaced — you can choose the tone you prefer:

✅ Option 1 – Simple and natural

Subject: Overlapping Output When Running RunAllMacros

Hello Ma’am,
Good day!

I checked the macro code and found that when I run the RunAllMacros() subroutine, the output from macro E overlaps with the values generated by macro C and macro D.

Kindly review the attached file to confirm.

Thank you!
Best regards,

Would you like me to make it sound a bit friendlier and conversational, or keep it professional and straightforward?


I checked the macro and observed that when I run the RunAllMacros() subroutine, the output from MacroE() overlaps with the values generated by MacroC() and MacroD().
To proceed with verifying the condition of the 1st and 2nd vessel in the macro, I would like to confirm the actual data for the Booking Number and Control Number.
If everything is okay, may I set a meeting for the discussion at your preferred location?

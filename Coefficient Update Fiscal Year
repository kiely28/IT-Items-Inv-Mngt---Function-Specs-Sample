Here’s a simple, professional sample email you can copy and adjust as needed:

Hello,

Good day.

The program has already been updated to include the template checking feature.

Please review and let me know if you encounter any issues or if further adjustments are needed.

Thank you.

Best regards,

Got it 👍
You want fiscal-year logic like this:

If D9 = Jan AND D10 = Mar
👉 use Year + 1

Otherwise
👉 use Year from C12 as-is


Below is a clean and safe update to your macro that supports month names (Jan, Mar) and still works even if the cells contain numbers.

✅ Logic Implemented

D9 (From)	D10 (To)	Year Used

Jan	Mar	C12 + 1
Any other	Any	C12

✅ Updated Macro (Copy–Paste Ready)

Sub CheckMonthYearMatch()

    Dim m1 As String, m2 As String
    Dim yr As Long, finalYr As Long
    Dim check1 As String, check2 As String
    Dim result As String
    Dim folderPath As String, fileName As String, filePath As String
    Dim templateWB As Workbook, wb As Workbook
    Dim templateWS As Worksheet
    Dim fileFound As Boolean
    Dim sourceWS As Worksheet

    Set sourceWS = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet1")

    ' Validate Year
    If Not IsNumeric(sourceWS.Range("C12").Value) Then
        MsgBox "Year value is invalid.", vbCritical
        Exit Sub
    End If

    yr = CLng(sourceWS.Range("C12").Value)

    ' Read month values as text (Jan, Feb, Mar, etc.)
    m1 = Trim(sourceWS.Range("D9").Value)
    m2 = Trim(sourceWS.Range("D10").Value)

    If m1 = "" Or m2 = "" Then
        MsgBox "Month values cannot be empty.", vbCritical
        Exit Sub
    End If

    ' Fiscal year rule
    If UCase(m1) = "JAN" And UCase(m2) = "MAR" Then
        finalYr = yr + 1
    Else
        finalYr = yr
    End If

    ' Build comparison strings
    check1 = finalYr & " " & m1
    check2 = finalYr & " " & m2

    ' Locate template
    folderPath = "D:\Coefficient\Template\"
    fileName = Dir(folderPath & "*.xlsx")

    If fileName = "" Then
        MsgBox "No template file found in folder.", vbExclamation
        Exit Sub
    End If

    filePath = folderPath & fileName
    fileFound = False

    ' Check if template is already open
    For Each wb In Workbooks
        If wb.FullName = filePath Then
            Set templateWB = wb
            fileFound = True
            Exit For
        End If
    Next wb

    If Not fileFound Then
        Set templateWB = Workbooks.Open(filePath, UpdateLinks:=0, ReadOnly:=True)
    End If

    Set templateWS = templateWB.Sheets(1)

    ' Compare values
    If UCase(Trim(templateWS.Range("D8").Value)) <> UCase(check1) Then
        result = "Valid period From does NOT match. Expected: " & check1
    End If

    If UCase(Trim(templateWS.Range("F8").Value)) <> UCase(check2) Then
        If result <> "" Then result = result & vbCrLf
        result = result & "Valid period To does NOT match. Expected: " & check2
    End If

    If result <> "" Then
        MsgBox result, vbCritical, "Check Result"
    End If

    If Not fileFound Then
        templateWB.Close SaveChanges:=False
    End If

End Sub

✅ Example

Sheet1 values:

C12 = 2025
D9  = Jan
D10 = Mar

➡ Output comparison:

2026 Jan
2026 Mar

💡 Want to Enhance Further?

I can:

Support month numbers (1–12) and names together

Allow other fiscal ranges (e.g., Oct–Mar)

Centralize fiscal logic into a reusable function

Auto-detect fiscal year based on month sequence


Just tell me what you want next 🚀

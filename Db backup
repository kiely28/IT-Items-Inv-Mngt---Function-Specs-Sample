Perfect — if you want only the structure (tables, stored procedures, views, functions) and no data, here is the cleanest way to clone the database as db_attendanceenvi.

✅ Method: Generate Scripts (Schema Only)

This is the safest and most commonly used approach.

Steps in SSMS

1. Right-click the source database

db_meetingattendance
➡️ Tasks
➡️ Generate Scripts…


---

2. When asked “Choose Objects”

Select:
✔ Script entire database and all database objects


---

3. Click Next → Set Scripting Options

Choose:
✔ Save as File (or open in new query window)

Then click Advanced (bottom-right).


---

4. In Advanced Options

Set:

Option	Value

Types of data to script	Schema only
Script for Server Version	Your SQL version
Script Triggers	True
Script Indexes	True
Script Primary Keys	True
Script Foreign Keys	True



---

5. Generate Script

Click Next → Finish
You will get a full database creation script.


---

6. Modify the top of the script

Find the line:

CREATE DATABASE [db_meetingattendance]

Change to:

CREATE DATABASE [db_attendanceenvi]

Also change any:

USE [db_meetingattendance]

to:

USE [db_attendanceenvi]


---

7. Run the script

Run it in a new query window.
It will create:

The new database db_attendanceenvi

All tables

All stored procedures

Views

Functions

Constraints

Indexes

No data copied



---

🎉 Result

You now have:

Original: db_meetingattendance

Clone (structure only): db_attendanceenvi


Everything except the data.

If you want, I can also generate a sample template script showing how the tables and stored procedures will look.

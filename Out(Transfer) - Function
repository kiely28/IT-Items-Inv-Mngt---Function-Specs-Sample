Perfect 👍 This is the Out (Transfer/Deployment) module of your IT Items Inventory Management System — where items are deployed, transferred, or moved out of storage.
Here’s a complete Function Specification for that module, formatted in the same style as your “In” module.


---

🧩 FUNCTION SPECIFICATION

Module: Out (Transfer / Deployment of IT Items)

System: IT Items Inventory Management

Page: editmeeting.aspx (Transaction → Out)


---

1. Function Overview

The Out Function handles the transfer or deployment of IT items from their storage location to another area, user, or department.
This module ensures that inventory records remain accurate by deducting quantities from the storage location and updating item status as “Deployed” or “Transferred.”


---

2. Process Flow

1. User navigates to Transaction → Out.


2. User inputs or scans the Control No of the item to be transferred.


3. The system retrieves related details (e.g., category, brand, serial number, current stock).


4. User enters the following required fields:

Quantity/Length

Warranty

Location of Deployment



5. System validates the quantity and item availability.


6. User clicks Deploy to finalize the transfer.


7. System updates the inventory database and records the transaction in the Out History.


8. User may click Clear to reset all fields.

3. Field Specifications

Field Name	Type/Control	Required	Description

Control No	TextBox / Auto Lookup	✅ Yes	Unique ID linking the item to its “In” record. Used to fetch item details.
Quantity/Length	Numeric TextBox	✅ Yes	Number or length of units being deployed. Must not exceed available stock.
Warranty	TextBox	✅ Yes	Warranty information (e.g., 1 Year, 6 Months). Helps track support coverage.
Location of Deployment	TextBox / Dropdown	✅ Yes	Indicates the new destination of the item (e.g., Office A, IT Room, Site B).



---

4. Validation Rules

Control No must exist in the In inventory records.

Quantity/Length cannot exceed current available stock.

Warranty field must not be empty and may follow standard format (e.g., numeric + duration).

Location of Deployment is required for record accuracy.

Prevent multiple “Out” transactions for the same Control No if stock = 0.

System prompts confirmation before final deployment (“Confirm deploy item to this location?”).



---

5. Database Interaction

Stored Procedures:

sp_ValidateItemAvailability → Verifies stock availability for a given Control No.

sp_InsertItemOut → Inserts deployment/transfer record into the tbl_ItemOut table.

sp_UpdateItemStock → Updates stock quantity in tbl_ItemIn or main inventory table.


Tables Involved:

Table Name	Purpose

tbl_ItemIn	Reference for checking stock and original item details.
tbl_ItemOut	Stores records of all deployed/transferred items.
tbl_Location	Stores reference locations for deployment.



---

6. Error Handling

Scenario	System Response

Invalid Control No	“Control No not found in inventory.”
Quantity exceeds available stock	“Insufficient quantity available for deployment.”
Missing required fields	“Please fill all required fields before deploying.”
Database or server error	“Unable to process request. Please try again later.”



---

7. Buttons and Actions

Button	Description

Clear	Clears all input fields and resets the form.
Deploy	Validates and saves the transfer record to the database. Updates stock accordingly.



---

8. Output / Result

Upon successful deployment:

The transaction is stored in tbl_ItemOut.

The stock quantity in tbl_ItemIn decreases.

A confirmation message is displayed: “Item successfully deployed.”


The deployed item’s status becomes “Out”, and its Control No remains traceable via reports or search.



---

9. Integration and Dependencies

Linked to In Module via Control No.

May integrate with:

QR Code Scanner (for Control No input).

Stock Summary Module (for viewing remaining items).

Reports Module (for deployment logs).




---

10. Future Enhancements

Add “Deployed By” and “Received By” fields for accountability.

Add QR Code confirmation to verify deployment at destination.

Include Export to PDF/Excel for deployment history.

Add Return or Recall Function for items coming back to storage.

Implement User Role Validation (only authorized users can deploy).

Perfect 👍 This is the Out (Transfer/Deployment) module of your IT Items Inventory Management System — where items are deployed, transferred, or moved out of storage.
Here’s a complete Function Specification for that module, formatted in the same style as your “In” module.


---

🧩 FUNCTION SPECIFICATION

Module: Out (Transfer / Deployment of IT Items)

System: IT Items Inventory Management

Page: editmeeting.aspx (Transaction → Out)


---

1. Function Overview

The Out Function handles the transfer or deployment of IT items from their storage location to another area, user, or department.
This module ensures that inventory records remain accurate by deducting quantities from the storage location and updating item status as “Deployed” or “Transferred.”


---

2. Process Flow

1. User navigates to Transaction → Out.


2. User inputs or scans the Control No of the item to be transferred.


3. The system retrieves related details (e.g., category, brand, serial number, current stock).


4. User enters the following required fields:

Quantity/Length

Warranty

Location of Deployment



5. System validates the quantity and item availability.


6. User clicks Deploy to finalize the transfer.


7. System updates the inventory database and records the transaction in the Out History.


8. User may click Clear to reset all fields.




---

3. Field Specifications

Field Name	Type/Control	Required	Description

Control No	TextBox / Auto Lookup	✅ Yes	Unique ID linking the item to its “In” record. Used to fetch item details.
Quantity/Length	Numeric TextBox	✅ Yes	Number or length of units being deployed. Must not exceed available stock.
Warranty	TextBox	✅ Yes	Warranty information (e.g., 1 Year, 6 Months). Helps track support coverage.
Location of Deployment	TextBox / Dropdown	✅ Yes	Indicates the new destination of the item (e.g., Office A, IT Room, Site B).



---

4. Validation Rules

Control No must exist in the In inventory records.

Quantity/Length cannot exceed current available stock.

Warranty field must not be empty and may follow standard format (e.g., numeric + duration).

Location of Deployment is required for record accuracy.

Prevent multiple “Out” transactions for the same Control No if stock = 0.

System prompts confirmation before final deployment (“Confirm deploy item to this location?”).



---

5. Database Interaction

Stored Procedures:

sp_ValidateItemAvailability → Verifies stock availability for a given Control No.

sp_InsertItemOut → Inserts deployment/transfer record into the tbl_ItemOut table.

sp_UpdateItemStock → Updates stock quantity in tbl_ItemIn or main inventory table.


Tables Involved:

Table Name	Purpose

tbl_ItemIn	Reference for checking stock and original item details.
tbl_ItemOut	Stores records of all deployed/transferred items.
tbl_Location	Stores reference locations for deployment.



---

6. Error Handling

Scenario	System Response

Invalid Control No	“Control No not found in inventory.”
Quantity exceeds available stock	“Insufficient quantity available for deployment.”
Missing required fields	“Please fill all required fields before deploying.”
Database or server error	“Unable to process request. Please try again later.”



---

7. Buttons and Actions

Button	Description

Clear	Clears all input fields and resets the form.
Deploy	Validates and saves the transfer record to the database. Updates stock accordingly.



---

8. Output / Result

Upon successful deployment:

The transaction is stored in tbl_ItemOut.

The stock quantity in tbl_ItemIn decreases.

A confirmation message is displayed: “Item successfully deployed.”


The deployed item’s status becomes “Out”, and its Control No remains traceable via reports or search.



---

9. Integration and Dependencies

Linked to In Module via Control No.

May integrate with:

QR Code Scanner (for Control No input).

Stock Summary Module (for viewing remaining items).

Reports Module (for deployment logs).




---

10. Future Enhancements

Add “Deployed By” and “Received By” fields for accountability.

Add QR Code confirmation to verify deployment at destination.

Include Export to PDF/Excel for deployment history.

Add Return or Recall Function for items coming back to storage.

Implement User Role Validation (only authorized users can deploy).

Would you like me to now combine your In, List, and Out module function specs into one formatted System Functional Specification Document (DOCX or PDF) for your project documentation folder?


---


Absolutely ✅ — here’s a Function Specification focused only on the List Screen (In/Receiving – Items List), covering Input and Output specifications just for that page (the one shown in your screenshot).

This version fits your IT Items Inventory Management project style and aligns with ASP.NET Web Forms + DataTables structure.

🧩 Function Specification Document

Module: In / Receiving – List Screen

Program File: InList.aspx / InList.aspx.cs

System: IT Items Inventory Management

Developer: [Your Name]

Date: [Date Created]


---

1. Module Description

The List Screen displays all items received and saved from the In/Receiving module.
It provides a searchable, paginated, and printable view of items with details such as Category, Brand, Quantity/Length, Serial Number, Location, and QR Code.
Users can also perform actions such as Edit and Delete on each record.


---

2. Input Specification (User Interaction / Actions)

Input / Action	Source	Description	Validation / Rules	Example / Expected Behavior

Search Box	User	Filters records in the DataTable based on keyword (Category, Brand, Serial, Location).	Real-time filtering; no empty validation needed.	Typing “Cisco” shows only Cisco items.
Entries per Page Dropdown	User	Changes number of rows displayed per page (10, 25, 50, 100).	Default = 10	Selecting “25” shows 25 items per page.
Pagination Controls	User	Navigates between pages of results.	Enabled only if results exceed visible page limit.	Clicking “2” shows next 10 entries.
Print Button	User	Exports or prints the current list of items.	Requires at least one record to print.	Generates PDF or print preview with QR codes.
Edit Icon (✏️)	User	Opens item record for editing.	Editable fields: Brand/Model, Location, Serial No (optional).	Clicking ✏️ on row 1 opens InEdit.aspx?ID=SW-1025-001.
Delete Icon (🗑️)	User	Deletes a specific record from the list.	Requires confirmation prompt (“Are you sure?”).	Clicking 🗑️ removes record from tbl_in.
QR Code Click (optional)	User	Opens enlarged QR image or download.	Optional feature; depends on system configuration.	Clicking QR displays popup QR preview.

3. Output Specification (Displayed Data / Results)

Output Field	Description	Source / Formula	Format / Example

#	Auto-generated row number per page	DataTable Index	1, 2, 3, …
Category	Category Code of the item	tbl_category.category_code	SW
Brand	Item brand or model	tbl_in.brand_model	Cisco Switch

---

4. Processing Logic

1. Page Load (Initial Display)

System executes query:

SELECT 
    i.control_no,
    c.category_code,
    i.brand_model,
    i.quantity,
    i.serial_no,
    i.location_stored,
    i.qr_code_path
FROM tbl_in i
INNER JOIN tbl_category c ON i.category_code = c.category_code
ORDER BY i.date_received DESC;

Data is bound to a DataTable or GridView with client-side search and pagination (using jQuery DataTables).



2. Search Filtering

The DataTable automatically filters visible rows based on the search box keyword.



3. Edit Record

When user clicks ✏️, the system redirects to the “In Edit” page:

InEdit.aspx?ControlNo=SW-1025-001

The selected record is loaded for update.



4. Delete Record

When user clicks 🗑️, a confirmation prompt appears.

On confirm:

DELETE FROM tbl_in WHERE control_no = @ControlNo

Table refreshes and success message appears.



5. Print Function

The “Print” button triggers print view or exports to PDF.

Data includes QR Codes, Control No, and essential columns.



6. QR Code Display

Each record shows its QR code.

The QR image is either:

Loaded from tbl_in.qr_code_path, or

Generated dynamically using a QR library based on control_no.






---

5. Output Behavior (System Response)

Event	System Response

Page Load	Displays latest “In” items in paginated DataTable.
Search Entry	Filters records instantly by keyword.
Change Page	Displays selected page of records.
Click Edit	Opens selected item’s edit page.
Click Delete	Confirms deletion, removes item, refreshes table.
Click Print	Opens print preview or generates PDF.
QR Hover / Click	Shows enlarged image or download prompt (optional).

Would you like me to include the “Print” function specification next — describing how the QR codes and item list are exported to PDF or print view (including layout and columns)?

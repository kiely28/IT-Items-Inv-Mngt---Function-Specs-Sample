Perfect 👍 This is the Out (Transfer/Deployment) module of your IT Items Inventory Management System — where items are deployed, transferred, or moved out of storage.
Here’s a complete Function Specification for that module, formatted in the same style as your “In” module.


---

🧩 FUNCTION SPECIFICATION

Module: Out (Transfer / Deployment of IT Items)

System: IT Items Inventory Management

Page: editmeeting.aspx (Transaction → Out)


---

1. Function Overview

The Out Function handles the transfer or deployment of IT items from their storage location to another area, user, or department.
This module ensures that inventory records remain accurate by deducting quantities from the storage location and updating item status as “Deployed” or “Transferred.”


---

2. Process Flow

1. User navigates to Transaction → Out.


2. User inputs or scans the Control No of the item to be transferred.


3. The system retrieves related details (e.g., category, brand, serial number, current stock).


4. User enters the following required fields:

Quantity/Length

Warranty

Location of Deployment



5. System validates the quantity and item availability.


6. User clicks Deploy to finalize the transfer.


7. System updates the inventory database and records the transaction in the Out History.


8. User may click Clear to reset all fields.




---

3. Field Specifications

Field Name	Type/Control	Required	Description

Control No	TextBox / Auto Lookup	✅ Yes	Unique ID linking the item to its “In” record. Used to fetch item details.
Quantity/Length	Numeric TextBox	✅ Yes	Number or length of units being deployed. Must not exceed available stock.
Warranty	TextBox	✅ Yes	Warranty information (e.g., 1 Year, 6 Months). Helps track support coverage.
Location of Deployment	TextBox / Dropdown	✅ Yes	Indicates the new destination of the item (e.g., Office A, IT Room, Site B).



---

4. Validation Rules

Control No must exist in the In inventory records.

Quantity/Length cannot exceed current available stock.

Warranty field must not be empty and may follow standard format (e.g., numeric + duration).

Location of Deployment is required for record accuracy.

Prevent multiple “Out” transactions for the same Control No if stock = 0.

System prompts confirmation before final deployment (“Confirm deploy item to this location?”).



---

5. Database Interaction

Stored Procedures:

sp_ValidateItemAvailability → Verifies stock availability for a given Control No.

sp_InsertItemOut → Inserts deployment/transfer record into the tbl_ItemOut table.

sp_UpdateItemStock → Updates stock quantity in tbl_ItemIn or main inventory table.


Tables Involved:

Table Name	Purpose

tbl_ItemIn	Reference for checking stock and original item details.
tbl_ItemOut	Stores records of all deployed/transferred items.
tbl_Location	Stores reference locations for deployment.



---

6. Error Handling

Scenario	System Response

Invalid Control No	“Control No not found in inventory.”
Quantity exceeds available stock	“Insufficient quantity available for deployment.”
Missing required fields	“Please fill all required fields before deploying.”
Database or server error	“Unable to process request. Please try again later.”



---

7. Buttons and Actions

Button	Description

Clear	Clears all input fields and resets the form.
Deploy	Validates and saves the transfer record to the database. Updates stock accordingly.



---

8. Output / Result

Upon successful deployment:

The transaction is stored in tbl_ItemOut.

The stock quantity in tbl_ItemIn decreases.

A confirmation message is displayed: “Item successfully deployed.”


The deployed item’s status becomes “Out”, and its Control No remains traceable via reports or search.



---

9. Integration and Dependencies

Linked to In Module via Control No.

May integrate with:

QR Code Scanner (for Control No input).

Stock Summary Module (for viewing remaining items).

Reports Module (for deployment logs).




---

10. Future Enhancements

Add “Deployed By” and “Received By” fields for accountability.

Add QR Code confirmation to verify deployment at destination.

Include Export to PDF/Excel for deployment history.

Add Return or Recall Function for items coming back to storage.

Implement User Role Validation (only authorized users can deploy).



---

Would you like me to now combine your In, List, and Out module function specs into one formatted System Functional Specification Document (DOCX or PDF) for your project documentation folder?

4. Processing Logic

1. Page Load (Initial Display)

System executes query:

SELECT 
    i.control_no,
    c.category_code,
    i.brand_model,
    i.quantity,
    i.serial_no,
    i.location_stored,
    i.qr_code_path
FROM tbl_in i
INNER JOIN tbl_category c ON i.category_code = c.category_code
ORDER BY i.date_received DESC;

Data is bound to a DataTable or GridView with client-side search and pagination (using jQuery DataTables).



2. Search Filtering

The DataTable automatically filters visible rows based on the search box keyword.



3. Edit Record

When user clicks ✏️, the system redirects to the “In Edit” page:

InEdit.aspx?ControlNo=SW-1025-001

The selected record is loaded for update.



4. Delete Record

When user clicks 🗑️, a confirmation prompt appears.

On confirm:

DELETE FROM tbl_in WHERE control_no = @ControlNo

Table refreshes and success message appears.



5. Print Function

The “Print” button triggers print view or exports to PDF.

Data includes QR Codes, Control No, and essential columns.



6. QR Code Display

Each record shows its QR code.

The QR image is either:

Loaded from tbl_in.qr_code_path, or

Generated dynamically using a QR library based on control_no.

---

Would you like me to include the “Print” function specification next — describing how the QR codes and item list are exported to PDF or print view (including layout and columns)?


---  


Perfect 👍 Based on your Out / Deployment screen and process flow, here’s a clear and complete Function Specification for both Input and Output sections — consistent with your In/Receiving module specs style.


---

🧾 FUNCTION SPECIFICATION

Module: Out (Deployment)

Page: Transaction / Out

File: Out.aspx


---

1. Module Description

The Out (Deployment) module handles the issuance or deployment of IT items from inventory to specific locations or users.
When the user scans a Control No, the system automatically retrieves all related details such as Category, Brand/Model, Warranty Expiration, and Quantity/Length from the database.
The user then scans or selects the Location of Deployment, and the record is saved as an outgoing transaction.


---

2. Input Specifications

Field Name	Description / Source	User Action	Logic / Validation

Control No*	Unique identifier auto-generated during the “In” process. Used to retrieve item info.	Scanned by user	- System validates if Control No exists in tbl_In.<br>- If valid, fetches related data: Category, Brand, Warranty, Quantity/Length, UOM.<br>- If invalid, show error: “Control No not found or already deployed.”
Quantity/Length*	Number or length of item issued.	Auto-filled or editable (depends on UOM)	- If UOM = pc, set default = 1 (non-editable).<br>- If UOM = m, user may input actual length deployed.<br>- Validation: must not exceed available stock.
Warranty*	Warranty expiration date.	Auto-filled	- Retrieved automatically from the item record in tbl_In.<br>- Not editable by user.<br>- If expired, show a warning: “Warranty expired on [date].”
Location of Deployment*	Destination where the item will be deployed.	Scanned or manually entered by user	- Must not be blank.<br>- Valid location codes are checked against tbl_Location.<br>- If invalid, show error message.



---

3. Processing Logic

1. Scan Control No

System queries tbl_In for item details where ControlNo = scanned value.

Retrieve and display: CategoryCode, BrandModel, Warranty, Quantity/Length, and UOM.

Check if Control No has already been used in tbl_Out. If yes, block further processing.



2. Auto-fill Warranty

The Warranty field auto-populates based on the value saved during the In transaction (tbl_In.WarrantyExpiry).



3. Quantity Logic

If UOM = pc, set Quantity = 1 and disable editing.

If UOM = m, allow the user to input the deployed length.



4. Location Validation

Validate if the entered or scanned location exists in tbl_Location.



5. Save (Deploy)

Upon clicking Deploy, system inserts data into tbl_Out with deployment details.

Update the item’s Status to Deployed in tbl_In.

Reduce or zero-out stock if partial quantity is deployed (for cable, etc.).





---

4. Output Specifications

Output / Result	Description

Success Message	“Item successfully deployed to [Location].”
Error Message	Display if Control No not found, invalid location, or insufficient stock.
Database Update	- New record inserted into tbl_Out:<br>  ControlNo, Quantity, Warranty, LocationDeployed, DateDeployed, UserDeployed.<br>- Update tbl_In.Status = 'Deployed'.
Transaction Log	System logs transaction details for audit trail (user, date, time, Control No).
Report View / List Page	The deployed item appears in the Out List page showing: Category, Brand, Control No, Quantity, Warranty, and Deployment Location.



---

5. Table References

Table Name	Purpose

tbl_In	Stores received items and their details. Used to retrieve info during deployment.
tbl_Out	Stores deployed item records.
tbl_Category	Used to determine UOM and warranty period.
tbl_Location	Reference table for valid deployment locations.



---

6. Business Rules / Conditions

Each Control No can only be deployed once unless returned or transferred back to inventory.

Warranty should not be modified during deployment.

If item has expired warranty, the system should still allow deployment but issue a warning message.

UOM = pc always implies Quantity = 1.

System should record DeployedBy (current user) and DateDeployed automatically.



---

Would you like me to include a sample database flow diagram or ERD link (showing tbl_In → tbl_Out → tbl_Category relationships)? That will make this function spec visually complete for your documentation.

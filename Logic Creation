That’s a great project — and you’re already thinking in the right modular direction 👍
Let’s build a clear logic flow and database concept for your IT Items Inventory Management System with three main modules: IN, TRANSFER, and DISPOSE/REPLACE.


---

🧠 OVERALL SYSTEM FLOW

Main goal: Manage IT items efficiently from entry (IN) → movement (TRANSFER) → end-of-life or replacement (DISPOSE/REPLACE), while tracking their location, status, and details via QR code.


---

🗂 MODULE 1: IN (Item Receiving & QR Generation)

🔹 Purpose

To record newly received items in the system, grouped by category, and generate a unique Control No and QR Code per item for tracking.

🔹 Process Logic

1. User scans/selects Category
→ e.g., Laptop, Printer, Router, etc.


2. System auto-generates Control No

Format: CAT-YYYYMMDD-#### (e.g., LAP-20251017-0001)


3. User scans or inputs:

Serial Number

Location (via QR or dropdown)

Brand / Model

Quantity or Length (manual input for cables, etc.)



4. System saves item details to Tbl_Items with status = "Active" or "In Storage"


5. System generates QR code per item containing:

Control No | Category | Serial No | Location | Brand/Model | Status


6. User prints QR label to attach to the item.



🔹 Example Table: Tbl_Items

Field	Description

ItemID (PK)	Auto-generated
ControlNo	Unique system-generated ID
Category	e.g., Laptop
SerialNo	From user input
Brand	e.g., Dell
Model	e.g., Inspiron 15
Quantity	1 (or length if cable)
Location	IT Storage, Office, etc.
Status	Active / Transferred / Disposed / Replaced
DateAdded	Timestamp
QRCodePath	File path of QR image



---

🚚 MODULE 2: TRANSFER (Item Movement)

🔹 Purpose

To track item movements between locations and maintain updated status and audit trail.

🔹 Process Logic

1. User scans item’s QR code
→ System fetches item details.


2. User selects new location
→ e.g., from “IT Storage” to “Admin Office”.


3. System updates:

Tbl_Items.Location → new location

Logs transfer to Tbl_Transfers



4. System sets status = "Transferred"


5. User can generate Transfer Report



🔹 Example Table: Tbl_Transfers

Field	Description

TransferID (PK)	Auto-generated
ControlNo	FK from Tbl_Items
FromLocation	Old location
ToLocation	New location
TransferBy	User performing transfer
TransferDate	Timestamp



---

🗑 MODULE 3: DISPOSE / REPLACE

🔹 Purpose

To handle end-of-life or defective items, with two paths:

Dispose → permanently removed

Replace → returned and replaced by supplier



---

🔹 Process Logic

Option A: Dispose

1. User scans item’s QR code


2. Selects “Dispose” reason


3. System updates:

Tbl_Items.Status = "Disposed"

Records to Tbl_Disposals



4. Item becomes non-transferable and removed from active inventory.



Option B: Replace

1. User scans defective item’s QR code


2. Selects “Replace” option


3. System updates:

Tbl_Items.Status = "Replaced"

Creates new entry in Tbl_Items for the replacement item

Links old and new item in Tbl_Replacements



4. Generates new Control No + QR Code for the new item.




---

🔹 Example Tables

Tbl_Disposals

Field	Description

DisposeID	Auto-generated
ControlNo	FK from Tbl_Items
Reason	e.g., Broken screen
DisposeBy	User who processed
DisposeDate	Timestamp


Tbl_Replacements

Field	Description

ReplaceID	Auto-generated
OldControlNo	FK (replaced item)
NewControlNo	FK (new item)
Supplier	e.g., Dell PH
ReplaceDate	Timestamp



---

📊 Optional Supporting Tables

Tbl_Category – master list of item categories

Tbl_Location – list of all item storage/deployment locations

Tbl_User – system users (for audit trail)



---

🔐 Status Lifecycle Summary

Action	Old Status	New Status

In	(none)	Active
Transfer	Active	Transferred
Dispose	Active/Transferred	Disposed
Replace	Active/Transferred	Replaced (new item becomes Active)



---

🧾 Example QR Code Content

Control No: LAP-20251017-0001
Category: Laptop
Serial No: SN123456
Brand: Dell
Model: Inspiron 15
Location: Admin Office
Status: Active

Would you like me to help you translate this logic into a database design (ERD + SQL table creation script) or flowchart (for documentation) next?
